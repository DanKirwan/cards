quick:

weird dark bit in create game screen with mdlist card packs



slow:

fix session stuff





stop admin changing when play again


add timer to game win with a timeout to leave


card selection time gets set to 0 and judging time to 57 need to reset to 60









done:

add support for judge leaving
telling everyone who is the judge for that round
all players selected acceleration


make judge cards darkened when you're not the judge
press enter to select name
fix html injection

advanced settings
sidebar needs fixing
say error message when setting max players
seeing when others select cards
pressing back to get to main menu doesnt leave the game (look into $on with location


add support for multi pick cards


first round it doesnt tell you who the card czar is
better play again system
card selection time needs to stop  interval when new game started
points should not reset at game win but when new game is started
