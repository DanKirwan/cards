quick:

fix html injection

make judge cards darkened when you're not the judge

fix asking for name twice on entry  (look at server side code and check if name is already set)

seeing when others select cards

pressing back to get to main menu doesnt leave the game (look into $on with location

press enter to select name

say error message when setting max players

weird dark bit in create game screen with mdlist card packs

slow:


add support for multi pick cards

add changing name ability


sidebar needs fixing

better play again system

advanced settings










done:

add support for judge leaving
telling everyone who is the judge for that round
all players selected acceleration
